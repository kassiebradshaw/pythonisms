## Overview

Python has many elegant features that can show the difference between a "programmer who uses Python" and a true "Pythonista"

Pythonista may be a silly word but it's a real thing. A true pythonista is able to leverage the particular features of Python to accomplish a task in a simpler and more easy to reason about way.

## Feature Tasks & Requirements

Create examples demonstrating pythonic language features. For example...

* Use iterators/generators on a custom collection to...
  * Add ability to be used in a "for in" loop
  * Add ability to be used in a list comprehension
  * Add ability to convert to a list or other collection type

* Create a decorator that adds behavior to a given function. For example...
  * Calculate the time spent in the function
  * Log relevant info for debugging purposes
  * Slow down the function
  * Convert the return value in some way

* Use dunder methods to make your code more readable and elegant. For example...
  * Add ability for two custom data structures to be considered equal
  * Add ability for custom data structures to be considered truthy/falsy

* Anything else that catches your interest
